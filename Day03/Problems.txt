Problem-01:
Write a Python program that accepts a comma-separated sequence of words as input and prints the words in a comma-separated sequence after sorting them alphabetically. Here's an example:

 Input: "dog,cat,apple,banana"
Output: "apple,banana,cat,dog"


Problem-02:
Write a Python program that takes a list of numbers as input and then sorts the list in descending order. Here's an example:
 Input: [5, 2, 8, 1, 9]
Output: [9, 8, 5, 2, 1]


Problem-03:
This problem requires you to write a Python program that checks whether a given string is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward. Here's an example:
 Input: "racecar"
Output: True



Problem-04:
This problem requires you to write a Python program that calculates the factorial of a given number. The factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted by n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. For example, 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120. Here's an example:
Input: 5
Output: 120
Explanation: 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.


Problem-05:
This problem requires you to write a Python program that finds the second smallest number in a list of integers. Here's an example:
 Input: [5, 2, 8, 1, 9]
Output: 2
Explanation: The second smallest number in the list is 2.



Problem-06:
This problem requires you to write a Python program that accepts two strings and then checks whether the two strings are anagrams of each other. An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once. Here's an example:
 Input: "listen", "silent"
Output: True
Explanation: "listen" and "silent" are anagrams of each other because they have



Problem-07:
A prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has no positive integer divisors other than 1 and itself. For example, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13 are prime numbers. On the other hand, 4, 6, 8, 9, and 12 are not prime numbers. Here's an example:

Input: 5
Output: True
Explanation: 5 is a prime number because it is only divisible by 1 and itself.


Problem-08:
write a program to generate a unique ID of 16 Digit(like : "PAK215IDN12BAN25"
you have a digit 0 to 9 and Alphabit A,to,Z
