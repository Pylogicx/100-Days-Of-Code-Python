# 100-Days-Of-Code-Python
Welcome to the 100 Days of Code Python repository! This is a repository created to track my progress during the 100 Days of Code challenge.

### About the Challenge
The 100 Days of Code challenge is a challenge that encourages developers to commit to coding for at least one hour every day for 100 days. The challenge is designed to help developers build a coding habit, improve their coding skills, and work on projects that interest them.

### Repository Structure
The repository is organized into folders for each day of the challenge. Each day's folder contains a file for the code I wrote that day and a README.md file to document what I worked on.
